This repository contains the source code for my universal homepage and project workbench, located at:
**[https://prathameshnium.github.io/](https://prathameshnium.github.io/)**

This site serves as the central landing page for all my various projects, repositories, and live demonstrations.

## 💡 A Philosophy of "Showing" in Science

This homepage is more than just a list of links; it represents a personal philosophy.

GitHub Pages are an amazing way to present work. They allow developers to go beyond just static code and create a live, interactive demo. It's refreshing to see this philosophy in the technology frontier: **build something, show it, and see if it sticks.** In many situations, this is a much better approach than the more traditional, paper-based methods of "older" sciences.

My own field is in Materials Science and Physics, which can often feel conservative and, at times, like it's "filled with just a stack of papers."

I strongly believe that my field can learn a lot from the dynamism and "show, don't tell" attitude of the tech world. This homepage is my personal effort to create that intersection. I want to try new, cool, and flexible ways of presenting my scientific research, making it more accessible, interactive, and engaging.

## 🔬 A Need for Better Science Communication

I believe it is crucial for scientists and researchers to demonstrate their work and actively show it to the public. Communicating with the people on whose money the entire system is built is very important. It also reduces the possibility of governments or other bodies misrepresenting the science.

Scientists should show visualizations of their papers and their work. We need better ways to communicate science **beyond the papers** and not remain in the bubble of our peers. Otherwise, the work itself risks losing value.

Now, more than ever, effective and direct science communication is needed at the frontier of research.
